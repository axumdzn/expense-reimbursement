# 404: Project Not Found Stand Up (3/30/22)

### General Information
 - Today is the day that the team is starting to work on the api layer of the project. 
As this backend currently has 4 routes that needs to be established today the easiest way to split this 
while still allowing for everyone to still get experience is to assign each person one api route to handle.
Therefor, everyone got one route
 - Grace got employee login
 - Julio got delete expense by id
 - Joseph got get total expenses
 - Ken got the create expense api call and will be doing an overall code check on the other layers/tests
 - The goal is to be able to be done with all of these api calls done by tomorrow so that there is 6 days to work on
the frontend of the project as it is the newest to most of the people and will take some time to become familiar with
the new languages
