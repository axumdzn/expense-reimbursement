# 404: Project Not Found Stand Up (3/31/22)

### General Information
 - Today with last day that people will be working on the api layer of this project, we will go through everyone's function
to make sure of its accuracy. Then we will move on to the front end starting tomorrow
 - How to handle the front end will have to be determined by the end of today or early tomorrow so that there will be things to work on in the
project

### Blockers
 - A merging error has caused one of the team members to lose data on one of the functions. As the function is not
a long and difficult function it was decided that the better option was to write the function again instead of trying to
revert to a previous version as this is faster and allows for more experience to be gained.
